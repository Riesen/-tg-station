	//IMPORTANT: Think of organdata as "hardpoints" for organs in a mob.
//It gives a container type that can stay constant while the actual organ itself changes.
//Well constant and constant, removing your head removes your brain container, for example
//This system is based on Bay's, so thanks to whichever coder originally designed it.
//But unlike Bay's system, we store most of the organ-related data in physical organs. These datums really are nothing more than hardpoints.

//ALSO IMPORTANT: If you want to actually do anything with an organ, check if it exists with exists() first,
//then access the organitem to perform the operations on. Organdata should not actually store most organ-related data.
//You can think of it like this: if you cut open your arm, and then rip it off, the cut is still on your arm even though it
//is no longer a part of your body. |- Ricotez
